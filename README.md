# Cinemeteor (Android â€“ Jetpack Compose)

## Project Idea

The **Cinemeteor** is a modern Android application that allows users to explore movies using **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**. Users can browse trending and popular movies, search for specific titles, and view detailed information like synopsis, rating, release date, and more. The app is built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Retrofit**, and **Room**, following modern Android development practices and clean architecture principles.
